# Images Overview

This folder contains three example images that showcase different visualizations of the Ulam spiral, focusing on prime numbers and specific categories within them. Each image provides a distinct view, emphasizing different aspects of prime number distribution.

### Image Descriptions

1. **ulam_spiral_no_category_600x600.png**: This image displays the Ulam spiral where all prime numbers are marked in white. No specific categorization is applied, allowing viewers to see the basic pattern formed by the primes in the spiral.

2. **ulam_spiral_with_quadratic_prime_600x600.png**: In this version of the Ulam spiral, quadratic primes are highlighted in green. These are primes that fit the formula \( n^2 + n + 41 \). Highlighting quadratic primes provides insight into the unique distribution pattern of this specific prime category within the Ulam spiral.

3. **ulam_spiral_with_twin_prime_600x600.png**: This image shows the Ulam spiral with twin primes highlighted in red. Twin primes are pairs of prime numbers that differ by 2, such as (11, 13) or (17, 19). Visualizing twin primes in red allows for an examination of their distinct placements within the spiral.

### Purpose of These Visuals

These images serve as examples to illustrate how different categories of prime numbers appear within the Ulam spiral. By color-coding specific categories, viewers can better understand the spatial relationships and distribution patterns of these primes in a unique, graphical format.
